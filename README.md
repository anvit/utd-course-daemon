utd-course-daemon
==================

This is a daemon which sends an email as soon as a requested course becomes available. This helps keep track of seats becoming available in select courses and helps manage enrollment. So far, I've kept this specific to my needs here at UTD, but anyone out there is welcome to play with this script to suit their requirement.
